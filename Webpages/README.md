# My Personal Portfolio
In this project, I will be designing and building my very own protfolio website. This website will be hard coded from scratch using HTML, CSS as well as some JavaScript. The purpose of this website is to act as a digital protolio where recruiters can view my particulars with ease without having to obtain the physical hardcopy portfolio or download my portfolio through email. This website will also act as a medium where recruiters can contact me.

## Design Process
In this section, I will be elaborating more on my design thinking process and how I formulate and design the final website that will cater to my user's needs and wants.

In order to gain a better idea of what should be included in my website, I will first have to identify potential audiences for my website and understand what they might be looking for. I will be standing in the shoes of various stakeholders and list the possible information which they might be looking for. The potential audiences are as follows:

* Recruiters. As a recruiter, I am intreseted in hiring someone who is experienced and qualified in the sector of Information Technology so that he/she is able to assist my company with our relevant projects. I also want to be able to understand what type of person I am potentially hiring so that he/she can promote and contribute to a healthy and freindly work environment. Furthermore, understand his/her personality would allow me to gauge how they will behave in our company's work environment and decide if they are suitable employees of my company/organization.

*  Scholarships patrons. As a scholarship patron, I want to provide and fund a diligent and hardworking person who is eager to do his best and perform well in their studies and will eventually contribute back to the society. I will need to know the personality as well as past achievements of the person in order to determine if they are potential candidates for my scholarship. Their past records would also give me an idea of what kind of person they are and would aid me in my judgement.

After having an idea of the types of infomation that a potential audience requires, I know have a better idea of what I need to include in my website. Hence, I will be including the following in my website:

* Personality
* Education history
* Work experience
* Personal projects/works
* My contact information

I can now start designing the layout of my website which can be done through the use of Adobe XD which will assist me in building my wireframe. This wireframe will provide a roguh image of what my website will eventually look like. It is also a good point of reference when I am designing my website.
