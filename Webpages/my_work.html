            The objective of this Assignment was to ideate 
            and implement a revamped version of any 
            mobile app icon. In My case, I decided to 
            redesign the File Manager App. I used Adobe 
            Illustrator to implement the revamped design.
            I also made use of the different design styles 
            as well as layouts that I have learnt during 
            lessons, combining them with works I 
            referenced in order to produce this final piece 
            of work.

            In this Assignment, I was tasked with 
            redesigning the splash screen for the app that I 
            have worked on in Assignment 1 which is 
            The File Manager app. However, the File 
            Manager was a fast app hence it did not have a
            splash page. I took the opportunity to design 
            a splash screen that would be suiting for this 
            app through the use of Adobe Illustrator and 
            Adobe Photoshop. I made use of similar colors
            in order to create a similar feeling so that users 
            would still recognise what app it is.

            The goal of this Assignment was to design an 
            infographic on the app that we have been 
            working on for the pass 2 assignments. And for
            me that was the File Manager App. We had to 
            list down the functionalities of the app or 
            statistics of the app which would bring about
            greater awareness of the app. With that kept in 
            mind I proceeded to design an infographic 
            talking about the functionalities of the File 
            Manager App. I made use of well known icons
            which would relate to their functions so that 
            general public would understand the 
            infographic before even reading the words. 
            This allowed for easy reading.

            As part of my Programming I module Project, 
            we were asked to design a simplified console
            game known as Simp City through the use of 
            the Python language which we have been 
            learning for the whole semester. I had to make
            use of functions, loops and dictionaries in order
            to write and develop an efficient code which 
            would allow our lecturers to easily read and 
            review it. It is also needed to keep our code 
            structured and clean. I also had to include input
            validation so as to prevent the code from 
            crashing should the user enter a wrong value.
