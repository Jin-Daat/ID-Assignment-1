        <p class="contentText">
          I enrolled in Innova Primary School which was considered
          a new school back in 2011. Throughout my time in primary
          school, I learnt about the basics of language proficiency, 
          mathematics as well the sciences. I also took on small 
          leadership roles as a class monitor and the Physical 
          Education Leader.

        <p class="contentText">
          Evergreen Secondary School was a school which presented
          me with many opportunities to hone my leadership skills 
          and to improve myself in ways which cannot be taught in 
          the classroom.  It was through such opportunities that I 
          was able to expand my horizons and become a more open
          minded individual. I also took up many leadership roles 
          which taught me how to be a caring and thinking member 
          of society.
