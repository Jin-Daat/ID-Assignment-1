# My Personal Portfolio
In this project, I will be designing and building my very own portfolio website. This website will be hard coded from scratch using HTML, CSS as well as some JavaScript. The purpose of this website is to act as a digital portfolio where recruiters can view my particulars with ease without having to obtain the physical hardcopy portfolio or download my portfolio through email. This website will also act as a medium where recruiters can contact me.

## Design Process
In this section, I will be elaborating more on my design thinking process and how I formulate and design the final website that will cater to my user's needs and wants.

In order to gain a better idea of what should be included in my website, I will first have to identify potential audiences for my website and understand what they might be looking for. I will be standing in the shoes of various stakeholders and list the possible information which they might be looking for. The potential audiences are as follows:

* Recruiters. As a recruiter, I am interested in hiring someone who is experienced and qualified in the sector of Information Technology so that he/she is able to assist my company with our relevant projects. I also want to be able to understand what type of person I am potentially hiring so that he/she can promote and contribute to a healthy and friendly work environment. Furthermore, understand his/her personality would allow me to gauge how they will behave in our company's work environment and decide if they are suitable employees of my company/organization.

*  Scholarships patrons. As a scholarship patron, I want to provide and fund a diligent and hardworking person who is eager to do his best and perform well in their studies and will eventually contribute back to the society. I will need to know the personality as well as past achievements of the person in order to determine if they are potential candidates for my scholarship. Their past records would also give me an idea of what kind of person they are and would aid me in my judgement.

After having an idea of the types of information that a potential audience requires, I now have a better idea of what I need to include in my website. Hence, I will be including the following in my website:

* Personality
* Education history
* Work experience
* Personal projects/works
* My contact information

I can now start designing the layout of my website which will include all information that the stakeholders might query for. I will be using Adobe XD assist me in building my wireframe. This wireframe will provide a rough image of what my website will eventually look like. It is also a good point of reference when I am designing my website. These are the wireframe for both the web and mobile view of my website:

## Features
In this section, I will be going over  the different parts of my website and briefly describing how each feature will help fulfil the user's needs.

### Existing Features
* Navigation Bar - Allow users to easily identify and move to the different sections of the website. Promotes an organized and formal website
* Education and Work Experience - Allow users to find out more about my background information and my work experiences
* Showcase Portfolio projects - Allow users to view past projects that I completed.
* Contact Me Form - Allow users to take note of my contact information as well as input their contact information for a two way communication.
* Links to other social platforms - Links to other social profiles are represented as their respective app icons and allow users to be redirected to them through a click on the icon.
* Skills and achievements - Allow users to take note of past accomplishments, relevant hardcore and softcore skills.

In addition to these existing features, another feature that can be added are accomplishments outside of academics. I believe this feature will be useful to my stakeholders as it would prove that I have a good work life balance and is able to manage myself despite being heavy loaded with work. Mentioning about my friends and family would also give them an impression of my social skills and how much I value my relationship with other which I believe is an important skill in a work environment.

### Features Left To Implement
* Description of non academic achievements.
* Description of relationships with friends and family members.

## Technologies Used
In this section, I will be mentioning all of the languages and other tools that I have utilized in order to construct this project.

* HTML - Hypertext Markup language was used to describe the structure of the website and consists of a series of elements. It tells the browser how to display the content. Click [here](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) to find out more on HTML.
* CSS - Cascading Style Sheets was used to describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in other media. IT saves a lot of work and can control the layout of multiple pages at once. Click [here](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) to find out more about CSS.
* JavaScript - JavaScript is the programming language for the web and can update and change both HTML and CSS. It can also manipulate and validate data. This language is used to make webpage interactive so as to improve user experience. Click [here](https://www.javascript.com/) to find out more about JavaScript.
* Canva - Canva is a colour wheel and colour theory generator which helps generate logically correct colours that are complementary, analogous, triadic, monochromatic as well as Tetradic. This tool was used to find out which colours to implement into my website Click [here](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/)to find out more on Canva color wheel.
* w3Schools - W3schools is an online learning platform that teaches and provides exemplary codes for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and many more. This site came in handy when I had difficulty implementing a particular feature to my website.

## Testing
In this section, I will be testing the user stories that have not been automated and provide necessary details for the testing process.

1. Contact Form:
    <br/>i. Select "Contact Me" page or head to the "Contact Me" section at the bottom of the home page.
    <br/>ii. Try to submit an empty form and ensure that a user prompt appears regarding the necessary input fields.
    <br/>iii. Try to submit a form with an invalid email address and ensure that a relevant message appears.
    <br/>iv. Try to submit the form will all valid inputs and ensure the a success message appears.

2. Socials Icon
    <br/>i. On any page, go to the footer of the page and locate "Follow Me" on the bottom right corner of the footer. Or head to the Home page or contact page to locate the app icons Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn
    <br/>ii. Ensure that there are three different app icons that being: Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn in that particular order.
    <br/>iii. Hover over the icons and make sure that there is a grey border surrounding the respective app icons.
    <br/>iv. Click on the app icons and make sure that they redirect you to the relavent social platform.

3. My Work Images
    <br/>i. Head to "My work" section of the website using the navigation bar.
    <br/>ii. Ensure that all images load. When hovering over these images, ensure that image border changes from white to grey.
    <br/>iii. Click on the image and ensure that they redirect you to another webpage.

4. Responsive Design
    <br/>i. Resize the web browser to any size
    <br/>ii. Ensure that contents do not overlap and are still readable.
    <br/>iii. Ensure that all other functions mentioned from the above (Test1-Test3) are working.

In the web version of my website, most of the contents will be stored in flex boxes which will resize accordingly depending on the screen size (viewport). If viewport is wide, contents will be arranges in rows, else, contents will be arranged in columns. In the mobile version, all contents will be aligned in rows to promote ease of reading as well as ensure that all contents can fit into the viewport.

Throughout the process of implementing this website, there are also some bugs which have yet to be addressed. For example, input fields are not cleared after submitting the form and user's input fields are still inside the input boxes.
