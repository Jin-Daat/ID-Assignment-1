              <p>I worked in Swee Heng Bakery in for 5 months as a part 
                time sales assistant. As a sales assistant, I have to learn 
                how to provide customers with fair, friendly and 
                courteous service. Opening and closing the store 
                together with counting the cash balance in the cash 
                drawer was also part of the job scope of a sales assistant.
                <br><br>
                Through this job, I learn how to manage customers' 
                demands and understand the importance of delivering 
                quality service to the customers. I also developed 
                resilience and was more quick witted due the fast paced
                environment.

            <p>As a Delivery Assistant, I was tasked with following the 
                driver around Singapore Island delivering items such as
                parcels, water tubs and documents. I was also taught how 
                to manage documents, uncontactable customers as well 
                as dissatisfied customers. Overall providing customers 
                with a pleasant delivery experience was the most vital
                role as a Delivery Assistant.                
              <br><br>
                I was able to gain a better insight as to how the logistics 
                industry function and empathise with delivery workers 
                who are trying their best to provide their service for 
                 customers during this Covid-19 Pandemic.

          <img src="Images/tracetogetherLogo.png" class ="tacetogether" alt="Trace Together Logo">
            <p>The role of a temperature screener was relatively simple,
                check that people entering the mall have scanned the 
                SafeEntry QR Code or tap their phones/tokens on the 
                Bluetooth device. 
              <br><br>
                However it was not all that simple as 
                there were members of public who were unwilling to 
                cooperate and abide by this Covid-19 measure. There 
                also people who would try to sneak pass temperature 
                screeners like myself to get into the mall without checking 
                in. As a staff I need to stop them from doing so as this 
                would pose a danger for everyone else in the mall.
